# Task Switching Bug Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The project was experiencing infinite task switching loops and restarting spam due to premature task set progression logic in `background_process.py`.

## Root Causes
1. **Premature Task Switching**: The `watch_device_optimized` method was automatically switching task sets on every loop iteration (lines 1242-1247), even when the current task set hadn't completed its objectives.

2. **Conflicting Progression Triggers**: The "Game Opened Ready To Use" task was using `BackToStory` flag which was being triggered repeatedly.

3. **No Safeguards**: There were no checks to prevent switching to the same task set repeatedly.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Automatic Task Progression (background_process.py)
- **Lines 1229-1231**: Removed the automatic task progression logic that was checking and switching task sets on every loop iteration
- Task progression now ONLY happens through explicit flags (NextTaskSet_Tasks, specific task completion flags)

### 2. Updated Restarting Task (restarting_tasks.py)  
- **Line 10**: Changed from `BackToStory: True` to `NextTaskSet_Tasks: True`
- This ensures progression only happens once when the game is ready, not repeatedly

### 3. Enhanced Task Switching Logic (background_process.py)
- **Lines 1003-1014**: Added safeguards to NextTaskSet_Tasks handler:
  - Only switches if actually changing to a different task set
  - Resets action tracking when switching to prevent false repetition detection
  - Logs current state for debugging

### 4. Improved BackToStory Handling (background_process.py)
- **Lines 1016-1028**: Made BackToStory legacy-compatible but safer:
  - Checks if actually changing task sets before switching
  - Includes safeguard against same-set switching
  - Resets action tracking on switch

### 5. Special Handling for Game Ready State (background_process.py)
- **Lines 135-140**: Added special handling in `track_action` method:
  - "Game Opened Ready To Use" task doesn't count as repetition
  - Resets action counts when game becomes ready
  - Prevents false restart triggers

## How Task Switching Should Work Now

1. **Restarting Tasks**: Run when game is closed/restarting
2. **Game Ready Detection**: "Game Opened Ready To Use" task triggers with `NextTaskSet_Tasks` flag
3. **Progression Logic**: `device_state_manager.get_next_task_set_after_restarting()` determines next task set based on device state
4. **Task Set Switch**: Only happens once, with action tracking reset
5. **Task Execution**: Current task set runs without premature switching
6. **Next Progression**: Only when a task explicitly triggers a flag (completion, error, etc.)

## Expected Behavior
- No more infinite switching between restarting and other task sets
- Task sets complete their objectives before switching
- Clear logging shows task progression path
- Error recovery still works through BackToRestartingTasks flag

## Testing Recommendations
1. Monitor logs for repeated "Task set progression" messages
2. Verify "Game Opened Ready To Use" only triggers once per restart
3. Check that task sets stay active until completion flags are triggered
4. Ensure error recovery (BackToRestartingTasks) still works when needed
